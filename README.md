# Mileud - Phaser RPG

This is the basic start of a RPG built with Phaser 3.

## Getting Started

First, download the repository to your local machine with the git clone link. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwinmoradian90/phaser-rpg.git
```

Then change directories into the project.

```bash
cd this/is/the/path/to/your/project.
```

Once in the project, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then in the terminal run the following.

```bash
npm install
```

After everything needed for the project is installed, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the project so you can view it [here](https://localhost:8000).

If you just want to check out the game without installing it, go [here]().
