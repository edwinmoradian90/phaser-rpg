# Mileud - Phaser RPG

[View Game](https://wizardly-villani-8dc33a.netlify.com/)

This is the basic start of a RPG built with Phaser 3.

The project had a dead line of five days total. Two of those days were allocated to designing, prepping, and learning, while the final three days were allocated to building the project.

## Design Process

At the end of day two, I had learned the basics of PhaserJS, specifically, the physics and motion. There were several objectives I had when starting day three. 

- MVP - Try to build the core functionality before dolling it up.
- Make sure what I do build is functional.
- Try to make the code scalable by focusing on building a system.
- The layout and look of the game can always change, but the functionality will become more difficult to alter over time. 

## Choosing the Building Blocks

Given the limited timeframe, there was not a lot of flexiblity afforded to me here, so I ran with what I could. Luckily, I found great music, sprites, and tilesets in a short amount of time. 

The design process here was dependent on basic cohesion, in order to fit the deadline.

## Getting Started

First, download the repository to your local machine with the git clone link. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwinmoradian90/phaser-rpg.git
```

Then change directories into the project.

```bash
cd this/is/the/path/to/your/project.
```

Once in the project, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then in the terminal run the following.

```bash
npm install
```

After everything needed for the project is installed, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the project so you can view it [here](https://localhost:8000).
