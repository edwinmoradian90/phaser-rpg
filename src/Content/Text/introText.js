        It is the year 2575. The "Great Struggle" has just ended
        on your home planet Nujamal. It was an ongoing war that was fought 
        in the shadows, long before you were even born.    
    `,
    `
        A war as old as humanity itself. Cyclical in nature, 
        there were periods of destruction and periods of peace,
        neither of which were ever completely realized. 
    `,
    `
        The fire, always in a state of kindling, never truly obtaining
        its true destructive power. Until now...
    `,
    `
        These flames were nested in the hearts of those that were never seen 
        or heard. They, hating humanity and its Creator, always sought
        the destruction of what was good. 
    `,
    `
        Their failures made them wiser, their limitations made them more clever.
        Until finally, the technology and infrastructure were available. Infiltrating
        the societies of the weak in mind and spirit, their influence grew, and with 
        this new-found technology, so did their control.

    `
        In the name of love and prosperity, they took hold of the very systems put in place to
        fight against this corruption. All of this, with the help of the people their system
        was designed to control. 
    `,
    `
        This war was waged not on the body, but on the minds of the people. 
        And because of fear in our hearts,

        The people lost... 
        Humanity lost...
        Now the fire has risen...
    `,
    `
        This is a message to all that can still see. 
        The fourth wall has been broken, and through it, I send you the truth while in a state 
        of immunity.

        Brothers. Sisters. 
        Please hear my cries of desperation. 
        I seek to save you from the flames that will consume you.

    `
        In the name of all that is Good, open your eyes.

        - Your brother,
        
        Mileud.
